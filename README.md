# Project: ToDo List
This project is part of The Odin Project, a to do list program. The user have an option to create a project or list, they can put a certain task in a project or list. The user can also edit the task even when they already submitted it already. A mode toggle is also added so the user have a choice when they want a light version or dark version. All data are stored in the user's device storage. I learned so much while doing this project and I had fun!
